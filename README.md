"Predict meteor showers using moon phases, constellations, cities, and meteor showers data. Get optimal viewing recommendations based on city input, matching constellations with showers, and analyzing moon phases. Plan your meteor observations effectively with this data-driven approach!"

# Meteor Shower Predictor

The Meteor Shower Predictor is a project that aims to provide users with predictions for the best meteor shower viewing opportunities. By leveraging data on moon phases, constellations, cities, and meteor showers, the program recommends optimal dates and locations for observing meteor showers.

## Features

- **City-based Recommendations:** Enter your desired city, and the program will identify visible constellations based on their latitude.
- **Matching Meteor Showers:** The program matches the visible constellations with corresponding meteor showers for accurate predictions.
- **Moon Phase Analysis:** By analyzing moon phase data, the program determines the date with the lowest moon illumination percentage during each meteor shower.
- **Data-driven Approach:** The predictions are based on reliable and up-to-date datasets on moon phases, constellations, cities, and meteor showers.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `meteor_shower_predictor.py` script.
3. Enter the name of your city when prompted.
4. The program will provide recommendations on the best meteor shower viewing opportunities for your city.

## Datasets

- **Moon Phases Data:** Provides information on moon phases, including dates and corresponding moon illumination percentages.
- **Constellations Data:** Contains latitude ranges for constellations, enabling the identification of visible constellations from a specific city.
- **Cities Data:** Includes information on various cities, such as names and latitudes.
- **Meteor Showers Data:** Provides details on meteor showers, including names, radiant constellations, and start/end dates.

## Note

Please verify the availability and accuracy of the datasets from reliable sources before planning your meteor shower observations.
